\chapter{Contributions to public Repositories}

This project embarked on a secondary mission to support existing public repositories by contributing valuable resources and tools that benefit the broader community. This goal was successfully met, as evidenced by the enhancements we made to some key repositories.

\section{pro\_gan\_pytorch repository}

We added new functionalities to one of the most used non-official PyTorch implementations~\cite{proganpytorch} of the PGGAN paper~\cite{karras_pggan}, making them available for the community. Our approved and merged pull request contributes to repository enhancement and can be found on GitHub: \url{github.com/akanimax/pro_gan_pytorch/pull/69}.

\section{diffusers repository}

We made a few enhancements to this leading Python library for SOTA pretrained diffusion models~\cite{von-platen-etal-2022-diffusers}, improving its functionalities and code quality. Our approved and merged pull request can be found on GitHub: \url{github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/3807}.

\section{data\_augmentation\_using\_synthetic\_images repository}

In an endeavor to contribute to the community, we developed and maintained a repository, housing the work done throughout this project. The repository can be found at GitHub: \url{github.com/fededemo/data_augmentation_using_synthetic_images}
